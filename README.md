Calculators for spline and polynomial interpolation

Inspired by the lectures of [Prof. Dr. Achim Kehrein](https://www.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/en/user/7351) on Numerical Mathematics. 

Primarily done as practice in MATLAB and Python, though if you find use from it, you are welcome to use it. 

## 🔧 Current Features
- Cubic spline interpolation from a set of data points (either clamped or natural, just change the flag variable)
- Polynomial interpolation from a set of data points (using [Newton's Approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_polynomial))
- Plots of both interpolations on the same axes for comparison
- Polynomial interpolation of 3 points (using [Lagrange's Approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial)) in Python

## 📦 Requirements
- MATLAB R2018b or later
- Python (only for Lagrange Interpolater)

## 🚧 Future Work
- Implementing cubic spline and newton interpolaters in Python and generalising the lagrange interpolater.
